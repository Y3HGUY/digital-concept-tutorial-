This Quote seems to be in relation to what maybe happening to many new students entering into the course of INFOTC 1600. Being a technogloal based course, covering all things tech many topics being covered may be new to others. And at first this may be intimdating yet I can assure you that you can do it! 

This step will mostly happen when the module for the week is published. This is where you can take a peek at the topics being covered in the given module alongside the assingments and disscussions for the given material. I would advise looking through all the things that are were published while also taking a mental note or even a physical note of what topics and resources you have to read, what you have to be thinking about for disscussions and if there is any prep worked needed for the given assignemnt that week. These may indlude have to watch some videos, read an article or even do some of your own background research in order to get a better understanding of the topic at hand.
