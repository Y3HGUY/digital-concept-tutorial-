This is the final project for my INFOTC 1600 class at the university of missouri 
## **Tutorial:** Success Plan for INFOTC 1600 
### **Author:** Tye Yeh 

**Desciption:** This is a tutorial for those currently enrolled in the INFOTC 1600 class at the University of Missouri Columnbia. This is also a loose tutorial for having success in other class that have a structure similar to this one. This is ment for those who are struggling with the workload in this course alongside provide an outline/plan for succeding in INFOTC 1600. 

## Objectives
1. Establish a plan for covering information.
2. Provide tips for better understanding of course information.
3. Have fun learning all there is to learn about technology!



### Step 1: take a peek at the material 
> *Those who climbs the ladder must begin at the bottom* 

This Quote seems to be in relation to what maybe happening to many new students entering into the course of INFOTC 1600. Being a technogloal based course, covering all things tech many topics being covered may be new to others. And at first this may be intimdating yet I can assure you that you can do it! 

This step will mostly happen when the module for the week is published. This is where you can take a peek at the topics being covered in the given module alongside the assingments and disscussions for the given material. I would advise looking through all the things that are were published while also taking a mental note or even a physical note of what topics and resources you have to read, what you have to be thinking about for disscussions and if there is any prep worked needed for the given assignemnt that week. These may indlude have to watch some videos, read an article or even do some of your own background research in order to get a better understanding of the topic at hand. 

### Bottom Line: 
1. Look at the module.
2. take a mental note of intial inderstanding.
3. Know that you can do it and will learn it! 



### Step 2: Create a Plan 
> *laying the ground work will allow for smooth building*

Now that you know and aware of the information that your are suppose to cover, it is very wise to create a plan or schedule for covering the information that is needed. This could be reading articles and or watching videos based on the information that is provided in the module relased. Be aware that you should also budget for time if you are not understanding the topic at hand. For example, personally the unit covering computer architecture came very easy to me, so when I was making my plan for covering that unit I didn't need that much time. And on the other side of spectrum I was not vary familair with the OSI Layers 
(Do not worry if you do not know these terms, you will come to learn them. Trust me!) And So when that unit was being covered I had added more time for me to do some extra research so I could fully understand it.

### Bottom Line:
1. Pull from your background knowledge to see it you have understanding of the topic.
2. Create a plan to cover the information in the module.
3. Create a plan to finish assignments or project. 
**Tips:** Understand that you are a student! Please be mindful of the other classes that you have.



### Step 3: Follow the Plan! (hopefully)
> "Hey shit happens" - Me

You have laid the ground work, and you know what you need to do is just follow the plan that you have set. And if you have created a good plan and all things go according to it then congrats! You have an easy week of INFOTC 1600. Although this is some life advice, stuff happens. Something may come up or maybe you fell a little behind, that kinda of stuff happens. And I will let you know that its okay. As long as you understand that when you are slacking you do need to pick it up at sometime. If you have stuck to your plan and have are done with the module then good job! You are done. If you haven't the next step is for you. 



### (Optioanl) Step 4: Take a Deep Breath and Realign 

If you have fallen a little astray then its not a super big deal. This is where you have to look at how much work you have to do and buckle down and make a new plan of attack to finish the assingments or cover the rest of the material the you needed to learn. A way to cover more information is to go to your search engine and just find more information on the topic in the current module. The internet is a very big place and is has alot of people the are very smart. People like [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/linustechtips)
